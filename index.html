      <h2>What is <span class="color-text">Parkinson</span>?</h2>
      <p>Parkinson's Disease affects the neurons in the brain responsible for the release of dopamine, which is a chemical neuro-transmitter that helps your body move. Dopamine sends messages to the body to help control movements, but this action is affected when you have Parkinson.</p>
      <br>
      <p id="park-message">It is very important to remember that Parkinson's disease <span class="color-text">affects people in many different ways</span>, therefore your <span class="color-text">symptoms and treatment may be different</span> from one person to another.</p>
