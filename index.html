      <h2>What is Parkinson?</h2>
      <p>Parkinson's Disease affects the neurons in the brain responsible for the release of dopamine, which is a chemical neuro-transmitter that helps your body move. Dopamine sends messages to the body to help control movements, but this action is affected when you have Parkinson.</p>
      <br>
      <p>It is very important to remember that Parkinson's disease affects people in many different ways, therefore your symptoms and treatment may be different from one person to another.</p>
