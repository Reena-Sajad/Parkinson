# Welcome to the Parkinson Information website

**An information website on Parkison's Disease and contact details for patients living in Oxfordshire.**

The information on this website was originally created on a patient's leaflet in 2017, through the Oxford University Hospitals NHS Trust when I was a 3rd year student nurse. 
I decided to compile the information on a website as it may be difficult for patients to find the link for the leaflet. 

The original leaflet can be found in a PDF format under the title "Have you recently been diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease?" on https://www.ouh.nhs.uk/patient-guide/leaflets/default.aspx.
